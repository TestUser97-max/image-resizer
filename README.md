# Image Resizer Plugin for Craft CMS

<img width="500" src="https://verbb.io/uploads/plugins/image-resizer/_800x455_crop_center-center/image-resizer-social-card.png">

Image Resizer is a Craft plugin that resizes your assets when they are uploaded. This allows huge images to be resized so as not to use up unnecessary disk space, but still kept at a reasonable resolution. This plugin is not a replacement for using image transforms throughout your site.

## Download

While Craft 3 is still in beta, you'll need to use Composer to download and install the plugin.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require verbb/image-resizer

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Image Resizer.
