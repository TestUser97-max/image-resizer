# Configuration

Create an `image-resizer.php` file under your `/config` directory with the following options available to you. You can also use multi-environment options to change these per environment.

```php
<?php

return [
    '*' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'imageWidth' => 2048,
        'imageHeight' => 2048,
        'imageQuality' => 100,
        'skipLarger' => true,
        'nonDestructiveResize' => false,
        
        'assetSourceSettings' => [
            '1' => [
                'enabled' => false,
            ],
            '2' => [
                'imageWidth' => 1028,
            ],
        ],
